## Abstract

This Creed outlines the technology selection rationale for the t0y-chain, emphasizing a platform of innovation and freedom. The decision to use Substrate over more mainstream frameworks such as Ethereum is rooted in our commitment to pioneering and experimentation without the constraints of established ecosystems.

## Rationale

The t0y-chain is envisioned as a platform where builders possess the utmost freedom to innovate. Substrate is selected for its highly customizable components that offer extensive playability and adaptability, aligning perfectly with our vision. Despite the popularity and vibrant ecosystem of Ethereum, our intent isn't merely to join an existing hot trend but to boldly explore new territories.

The lesser-trodden path of the Polkadot ecosystem represents an uncharted area that beckons those who thrive on challenges to breathe life into it. It is a space free from historical baggage, allowing us to act on our desires to innovate and build freely. As described in Creed C-0, this is a self-customizable, self-built system where everything could potentially be redefined or reimplemented in the future by collective will. Thus, choosing the Polkadot ecosystem aligns with our goals of pioneering and community-driven development.

Furthermore, as we progress, there exists the opportunity to seek support from the Web3 Foundation (W3F) and contribute back by developing open-source components that enrich the ecosystem. This reciprocal relationship not only aids our project but also fortifies the broader framework we operate within.

## Specification

The t0y-chain will operate as a parachain within the Polkadot network. Leveraging this architecture, t0y-chain's security will be ensured by the broader Polkadot framework, allowing our team to focus primarily on our unique business functionalities. Moreover, the existence of numerous parachains on Polkadot and support for Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM) presents an excellent opportunity for us to explore the use cases of Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP). This positions t0y-chain as an early pioneer in this emerging field, potentially leading developments within this sector.
