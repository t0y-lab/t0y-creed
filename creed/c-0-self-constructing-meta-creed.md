## Abstract

Creed No.0 (C-0) serves as the foundational framework for all subsequent Creeds within the t0y ecosystem. Designed to be self-constructing and self-evolving, it sets the initial rules and provides mechanisms for its own modification and evolution through community-driven proposals and on-chain governance. As the inaugural Creed, it embodies our ethos to empower and engage every stakeholder in the t0y ecosystem.

## Rationale

The rationale behind C-0 is rooted in the need for a flexible, adaptive governance model that can evolve in response to the community's changing needs and insights. Traditional static governance models often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological and social changes. C-0, by being self-referential and capable of iterative evolution, ensures the governance structure remains relevant and responsive. This approach not only fosters innovation and inclusivity but also enhances the platformâ€™s resilience by embedding adaptability into its core framework.

## Specification

### Creed Syntax

The structure for writing a Creed is standardized to ensure consistency across the t0y.life ecosystem. Each Creed document is carefully formatted to follow specific naming and content guidelines.

**File Naming**

Creed files are named using the pattern `c-x-y.md`, where `X` represents the Creed index and `Y` the title of the Creed. The entire filename should be in lowercase to maintain uniformity. Titles should use Pascal Case, which means using hyphens (`-`) to replace spaces between words.

**Document Header**

Every Creed document starts with a specific header format, `ðŸ“„ # C-X Y`. Here, `X` is the index of the Creed, and `Y` is the title, reflecting the specific focus of the Creed.

**Content Sections**

The content of each Creed must include, but is not limited to, the following sections:

* A state table (refer to the beginning of this Creed)
* `## Abstract`
* `## Rationale`
* `## Copyright`

These sections should appear in the order listed above to ensure a consistent reader experience.

**Section Titles**

Titles for each section should be in Title Case, where the first letter of each major word is capitalized, except for certain shorter words, such as prepositions and articles, unless they are the first or last word in the title. This style is commonly known as "Title Case."

### Self-Constructing Nature

C-0 is a Meta-Creedâ€”a Creed about Creeds. It establishes fundamental principles and processes for proposing, reviewing, and implementing all other Creeds. Key features include:

* **Self-reference**: C-0 defines and continually redefines itself, setting a precedent for how Creeds interact and influence each other.
* **Iterative Evolution**: Creeds, including C-0, can be modified by subsequent Creeds, ensuring the governance model adapts to the community's evolving needs.

### Example of Operation

Consider the proposal of C-1. If a community member proposes C-1, it would be conceptualized as follows:

```rust
type Creed = ..;
type Proposal = ..;

let c_0_proposal = ..;
let c_0 = |p: Proposal| -> Creed { .. };
let c_1 = c_0(c_1_proposal);
```

This expression signifies that C-1 is derived from applying a new proposal to C-0, with specific changes and adaptations defined within the proposal itself.

### Community-Driven and On-Chain Governance

* **Community Input**: Every member of the t0y community can contribute to the discussion and modification of Creeds, including C-0, ensuring the platform evolves to reflect diverse perspectives.
* **On-Chain Implementation**: Approved proposals are implemented on-chain, ensuring transparency, security, and the immutability of changes.

### Modifying C-0

Due to its foundational nature, modifications to C-0 can significantly impact the entire t0y ecosystem:

* **Proposal for Modification**: Any community member can submit a proposal to modify C-0, which is then reviewed and discussed following established processes.
* **Potential for Comprehensive Changes**: Approved modifications to C-0 could alter the fundamental governance and operational structures of future Creeds.
