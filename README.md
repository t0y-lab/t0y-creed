# üèõÔ∏è Overview

## Creed

**Welcome to t0y creed**, the central hub for fostering innovation and implementing enhancements within the t0y project. Our mission is to cultivate a playful yet impactful environment where community-driven proposals lead to consensus and evolution within the t0y ecosystem.

## Purpose

creed.t0y.io is conceived as a pivotal arena where community members, developers, and stakeholders of the t0y project can propose, discuss, and refine ideas and improvements. Here, we view every improvement proposal ‚Äî or "creed" ‚Äî as part of a larger game, turning the process of enhancement into an engaging and enjoyable experience. This approach aligns with our vision of "To Zero Yokes," aiming to liberate through innovation while ensuring that participation is as enjoyable as playing with toys.

## How It Works

1. **Post Your Ideas**: Visit [https://github.com/orgs/t0y-lab/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/t0y-lab/discussions) and boldly propose your ideas. This is your stage to inspire changes and innovations within the t0y ecosystem.
2. **Community Review and Discussion**: Once your idea is posted, it opens up for the community to review and discuss. This collaborative phase is essential for refining proposals and gaining diverse perspectives.
3. **Selection for On-Chain Governance**: The most engaging and popular discussions, currently the top x (x = 1), will be selected for on-chain governance. This moves the proposal into a formal voting and decision-making process.
4. **Implementation**: Once governance approves a proposal, the implementation phase begins. The approved changes are developed and integrated into the t0y platform, bringing the community's collective vision to life.

## Goals

* **Innovate and Enhance**: Continuously improve the t0y platform by embracing innovative ideas from our community, while ensuring the process is enjoyable and playful.
* **Community-Centric Governance**: Engage the t0y community in the decision-making process, ensuring that the platform evolves in a way that benefits all users and provides entertainment.
* **Transparency and Openness**: Maintain transparency in how decisions are made and how proposals are handled, fostering trust and openness within the community.
